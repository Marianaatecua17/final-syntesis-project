<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project
</p>

  <li>Electric energy</li>
  <p>
    Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
    kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as
    the energy that has been converted from electric potential energy. We can
    define electrical energy as the energy generated by the movement of
    electrons from one point to another. The movement of charged particles
    along/through a medium (say wire) constitute current or electricity.

  <li>Watt (physical unit)</li>
  <p>
    The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard
    unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second.
    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy
    isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated,
    absorbed, or dissipated

  <li>Scatter plot</li>
  <p>
    A scatter chart, also called a scatter plot, is a chart that shows the
    relationship between two variables. They are an incredibly powerful chart
    type, allowing viewers to immediately understand a relationship or trend,
    which would be impossible to see in almost any other form.

  <li>Linear regression</li>
  <p>
    In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the
    relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory
    variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear
    regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear
    regression.

  <li>Renewable energy</li>
  <p>
    Is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate
    than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources
    that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are
    plentiful and all around us.
